    <h1>Filesystem Tutorial</h1>
    <p>Now that you are comfortable with navigating through your files using UNIX, let's make a directory to practice with.</p>
    <p>From your home directory, navigate to a directory where you want to store your projects. </p>
    <p>For example, you might want to navigate to your documents folder.</p>
    <h2>cd documents</h2>
    <p>Now, you can create the directory using the command </p>
    <h2>mkdir [directory name]</h2>
    <p>Now that you have made the directory, you can navigate to that directory using</p>
    <h2>cd [directory name]</h2>
    <p>Now you can make files in this directory</p>
