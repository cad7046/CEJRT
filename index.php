    <h1>Welcome to CEJRT's All About UNIX</h1>

    <p>In this site we have attempted to explain some of the fundamentals of UNIX with some added topics
    relating to web site management.  Feel free to read through the topics ranging from navigating a file
    structure to file & directory permissions and remote connectivity to a web site.  Each topic has a corresponding
    tutorial and quiz.  The quiz will inform the user whether their answers are correct or not.</p><br>

    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
