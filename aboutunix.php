    <h1>What is UNIX?</h1>
    <p>At its core Unix is a multi-tasking, multi-user operating system that provides numerous functions for users such as text editors, development tools, a mailing system and more. Unix was created in the 1960â€™s by two developers working at Bell Labs (now known as the AT&T Bell Laboratories) with the intention on bringing a relatively simple to use portable operating system for computer hardware in to the realm of general use. Today, Unix is used in countless mainframes and web servers to store and maintain various useful information.</p>
